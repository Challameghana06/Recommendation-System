# 🎯 Recommendation System

## 📄 Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Recommendation System**, an essential component of modern data-driven applications like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.  
A recommendation system predicts what a user may prefer by analyzing past behaviors, similarities, and user-item interactions.

In this notebook, different recommendation strategies are explored to understand how data-driven personalization works — improving user experience and engagement.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To implement **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** techniques.  
- To compute user-item similarities and generate personalized recommendations.  
- To understand evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE for recommendation quality.  
- To visualize patterns and insights from user-item interaction data.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Surprise  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Key Steps
1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Import and analyze the dataset for missing values, user behavior, and rating patterns.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and format data for modeling.  
3. **Model Building** – Implement different types of recommender systems:
   - **Content-Based Filtering:** Uses item features and cosine similarity.  
   - **Collaborative Filtering:** Based on user-item interactions (using `Surprise` library).  
4. **Evaluation** – Assess performance using RMSE, MAE, or precision-recall metrics.  
5. **Visualization** – Plot rating distributions and top recommendations.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- The model successfully identified **top recommended items** for users based on preferences.  
- Demonstrated both **user-based** and **item-based** similarity approaches.  
- Provided insights into how recommendation engines personalize experiences in real-world applications.
